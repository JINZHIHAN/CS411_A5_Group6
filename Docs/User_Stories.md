1.	After logging in, I would like to see a list of recipes that would be suited towards my goal. I can then choose a recipe that I enjoy and see a list of the ingredients and preparation information. 

2.	Based on the calories I burn from the FitBit app, the app should tell me how many calories I need to eat and give me recipes based off of those calories so I can avoid looking for a faster potentially unhealthy option. 

3.	With the displayed recipes, this app should also offer me information about prep time and ingredients needed in the recipe.
