Sec: A5 Group 6 – Prototype Writeup

For our meal planner app, we use EJS, HTML, and Javascript on both front and back end, because they are tightly integrated together as well as for ease of coding and its simple functionality features. We are using Angular JS and Webstorm IDE for the bulk of the coding, purely because Angular JS supports different browsers which we found convenient considering our group uses different default browsers. It would also ensure expandability of the app. 
We are using UniRest with JQuery for API calls to the FitBit API. Simplicity was the main factor in choosing UniRest for this purpose, because of the detailed resources available on it. We use cookie session code to help us keep track of browser cookies so as to help simplify the process generating meal plans, especially when repetition happens often with a particular client (such as when their calorie use for the day does not vary very much). Passport will be used to help handle third-party authorization to FitBit.
We plan on using MongoDB as our database, and will be using Mongoose to handle database implementation, as per Professor Donham’s recommendations in class, purely because of curiosity as to its functionality.
